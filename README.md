# Snapagram
This is a website that I am working on that allows for some of the core functionalities of a social media website.
This project is just for fun/my own personal education.

## Hosting
The website uses an API that I deployed onto Heroku. The website is currently being hosted on snapagram.netlify.app.

First run `npm install`
then `npm start`
